## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Claude Users

2. **Use artifacts**: Ask Claude to create files for outputs
3. **Reference the skill**: Say "following the CSS Theme Transformer skill..."
4. **Iterate**: Get basic transformation first, then refine

### For Custom GPT Users
1. **Test thoroughly** before sharing with team
2. **Use conversation starters** to guide users
3. **Update knowledge files** as standards evolve
4. **Version your GPT** (track changes in docs)

### For Both
1. **Start simple**: Single-file, basic color swaps
2. **Build complexity**: Add typography, then spacing, then effects
3. **Always validate accessibility**: Don't skip this step
4. **Keep learning**: CSS and accessibility standards evolve
